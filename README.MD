# <Homework Week 1>

- The motivation to create this proyect is to put in practice what we learn through the first 3 clases of this Bootcamp.
- I build this proyect to test my knowledge, to see how much of what i was able to get and I am able to show.
- Solves the challenge of building something fro scratch and make sure I am able to take care of each detail.
- I learn the structure of a basic code, how important it is to pay attention on every class, spelling and make sure every detail is the same when you want changes to be reflected on diferent partos of the web.
